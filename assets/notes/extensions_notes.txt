[b]About extensions[/b]

Extensions are Scribe3 apps that can be developed and dropped-in independent of the main Scribe3 runtime.

[i]How to use[/i]
Just click on the extension you want to use.

[i]Installing new extensions[/i]
If you are using the [font=assets/fonts/Courier-New]ia-scribe[/font] Debian/Ubuntu package, you are going to be limited to the bundled extensions for the time being.
If you are running Scribe3 from source, you can install new extensions by dropping a compliant python module in the [font=assets/fonts/Courier-New]extensions/[/font] folder.

[i]Notes[/i]
Use the 'EXIT APP' button to exit a running extension.

Loading mechanics: extensions modules are dynamically loaded at app initialization. Extensions that fail to adhere to the interface, contain errors or cannot otherwise be imported will be ignored. Only callables in __init__.py are called during extensions setup, with the main runtime being called when the user clicks. If the main runtime fails gracefully, it is handled and a popup is shown.

Both users and developers should be cognizant that Extensions UI elements are scheduled on the main application thread, and can therefore crash Scribe3.
